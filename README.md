# Overview

I am making simple games like this one in languages that I have no experience in so that I can expand my coding language knowledge.

This is a simple game off Tik Tak Toe. The computer doesn't have any special ai with it. It will just go randomly. 

Like I said, the reason I'm making this program, is to get a feel for the C++ language, which I've never used before.

# Future Work

* In the future, I'd like to add some psuedointelligence to the computer that you play against. Things like it purposly stopping you from winning.
* Code in a way for the computer to go first sometimes.
* Add a mode for 2 players to play against each other instead of one player vs the computer.
